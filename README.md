My implementation website that comes from a mock up. The website uses Bootstrap grids, CSS variables, is responsive and has smooth transitions.

On the left is the mock up. On the right is the actual website.<br>
The scale is a bit off because the mockup shows the entire site while the right images show the page as the user would see it.
